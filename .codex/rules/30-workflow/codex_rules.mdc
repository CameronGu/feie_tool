  # Rule Title (sentence case)
  - **Bold lead-in** followed by concise guidance
  - Supporting bullets with actionable detail
  ```

- **Style & Tone**
  - Keep prose succinct and directive; focus on observable behavior.
  - Use ASCII characters unless the project already relies on Unicode.
  - Favor bullet lists over long paragraphs for scanability.

- **File References**
  - Use inline code paths with optional line numbers (e.g., `app.py:37`).
  - Link only to real files that exist in the repository.
  - Reference companion rules by path (e.g., `30-workflow/task-execution.mdc`).

- **Code Examples**
  - Provide fenced code blocks with language hints. Example:
    ```python
    example = True
    ```
  - Highlight preferred patterns with ✅ comments and anti-patterns with ❌ only when both add clarity.
  - Keep examples minimal and drawn from real project scenarios.

- **Maintenance**
  - Update rules when process changes occur or better examples emerge.
  - Remove outdated guidance promptly to avoid ambiguity.
  - Cross-link related rules to reduce duplication and aid discovery.
